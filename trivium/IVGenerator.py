    Trivium stream cipher
    Trivium has been designed by Christophe De Canni√®re and Bart Preneel. It is a 
    stream cipher (i.e. a cryptographic-strength RNG) selected by eSTREAM  (part of
    the the EU ECRYPT project) to be part of a portfolio of secure  algorithms

        # block until the system urandom entropy pool is initialized (128 bits of entropy are collected by the kernel). 
        # See the PEP 524 for the rationale. On Linux, the getrandom() function can be used to get random bytes in non-blocking mode (using the GRND_NONBLOCK flag) or to poll until the system urandom entropy pool is initialized.
        # On a Unix-like system, random bytes are read from the /dev/urandom device https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki//dev/random. 
        # If the /dev/urandom  device is not available or not readable, the NotImplementedError exception is raised.
        # On Windows, it will use BCryptGenRandom().
        # os.urandom uses system entropy sources to have better random generation. 
        # Entropy sources are something that we cannot predict, like asynchronous events. 
        # For instance the frequency that we hit the keyboard keys cannot be predicted. 
        # Interrupts from other devices can also be unpredictable.
