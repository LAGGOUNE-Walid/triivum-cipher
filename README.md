# Triivum Cipher

This repository contains an implementation of the Trivium cipher in Python. Trivium is a synchronous stream cipher designed to provide a flexible trade-off between speed and gate count in hardware, and reasonably efficient software implementation. It was submitted to the eSTREAM project and is part of the final portfolio in the hardware category.

## Features

- **Text Encryption/Decryption**: Encrypt and decrypt text files using the Trivium cipher.
- **Image Encryption/Decryption**: Encrypt and decrypt image files, demonstrating the cipher's versatility.



- **`images/`**: Contains sample images for testing the image encryption/decryption.
- **`trivium/`**: Contains the core implementation of the Trivium cipher and utility functions.
- **`image-enc.py`**: Script for image encryption and decryption.
- **`text-enc.py`**: Script for text file encryption and decryption.
- **`Research and implementation of Trivium algorithm - LAGGOUNE Walid M2 RRM.pdf`**: Detailed research document on the Trivium algorithm by Walid LAGGOUNE.
